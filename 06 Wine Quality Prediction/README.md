# Wine Quality Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine based on its chemical properties using machine learning classification models. The dataset includes various physicochemical tests such as acidity, sugar content, sulphates, alcohol percentage, and more. The goal is to identify the most influential features and build a model to accurately classify wine quality.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- **Source**: [Wine Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset)
- **Attributes**: 12 physicochemical features + 1 quality score
- **Target Variable**: `quality` (score from 3 to 8)
- 
## Key Learnings

- **Classifier Models**: Compared the performance of Random Forest, SGD, and SVC.
- **Feature Analysis**: Alcohol content is the most critical indicator of wine quality.
- **Data Visualization**: Used Seaborn and Matplotlib for deeper understanding of data patterns.
