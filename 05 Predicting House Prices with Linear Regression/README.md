#  House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model using **Linear Regression** to estimate house prices based on various features. This project provides hands-on experience with data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about residential houses, including:
- Area
- Number of bedrooms, bathrooms, stories
- Parking availability
