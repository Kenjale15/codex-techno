#  Credit Card Fraud Detection

##  Overview
This project uses machine learning to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset is highly imbalanced and anonymized using PCA-transformed features. Our goal is to identify fraudulent transactions with high precision and recall while minimizing false positives.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- 
## 🎯 Objective

- Detect fraudulent transactions accurately
- Handle severe class imbalance
- Compare multiple machine learning models
- Interpret model performance using metrics and visualizations

##  Final Thoughts

This project demonstrates how machine learning models like Random Forest can detect fraud effectively when class imbalance is addressed. While false negatives still exist, this lays the foundation for further model optimization.
